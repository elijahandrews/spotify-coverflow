# SpotifyCoverFlow

My fork of github.com/kylesurowiec/spotify-coverflow, thanks for the base!

This serves high resolution artwork for your currently playing spotify song via
http. The idea is that you run this server somewhere on your local network, and
then access the artwork from any laptop/tablet/phone. I use this to see nice
artwork on my iPad when I'm sitting on the couch listening to music.

Keys and callback URI are given with your personal Spotify developer account, register here: [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/). They go in credentials.py
